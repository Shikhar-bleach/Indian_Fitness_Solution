						 <p><b>1.) Whey Protein</b>
					     The body uses protein to build muscles, and a bodybuilder who supplements with a large amount of protein can help their muscles to recover and to grow much more rapidly than they would otherwise. Some protein powders also have complex carbohydrates, which are able to increase an athlete’s energy without causing the user to gain fat.Each scoop of the powder contains a high concentration of several amino acids, such as glutamine, arginine, lysine, alanine and glycine. Certain types of protein also have a relatively large amount of branched-chain amino acids.Certain types of protein also provide 50 milligrams to 250 milligrams of digestive enzymes in each serving. These compounds help the body to absorb a higher percentage of the protein, and some users have reported that the substances prevent any stomach discomfort that the individuals had experienced when using other types of protein powder.A bodybuilder should mix one scoop of the powder with seven ounces to 12 ounces of liquid, and each athlete may take as many as four servings of the supplement every day. In order to achieve optimal results, the protein should be ingested during the first 45 minutes after a workout has been completed.

						 <img src="images/creatine.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="creatine" title="creatine">
						 <p><b>2.) Creatine</b>
						 This substance is able to boost the volume of water in the skeletal muscles, and in addition to increasing their size, creatine allows extra nutrients and vitamins to reach the muscles. The compound can also increase a person’s body mass and strength, and in one study, the substance was able to augment the amount of weight that an athlete could lift by eight percent after the individual had used 15 grams of creatine every day for two weeks. Although creatine provides numerous benefits, it may increase the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, or DHT, and this inactive form of the hormone can cause several negative side effects. In order to reduce or to eliminate creatine’s effect on the conversion rate, a bodybuilder should also take maca root, stinging nettle, catuaba or astaxanthin.Athletes can consume five grams to 25 grams of creatine each day. Some experts recommend that individuals should use the substance every day for several weeks before taking a break from supplementation for at least one week. This strategy will ensure that the athlete does not develop a tolerance to creatine.

						 <p>4.) Omega-3 Fatty Acids 
						 These natural compounds are able to enhance the levels of testosterone in the body, and some studies have shown that the fatty acids cause protein and nutrients to be absorbed by the muscles instead of being consumed by the fat cells. This product is also a powerful antioxidant, and in addition, omega-3 fatty acid is able to improve endurance by strengthening the cardiovascular system. The substance also ameliorates the texture and the elasticity of the hair and the skin.Most companies that manufacture and sell these products recommend that users should consume as much as 2,000 milligrams of fish oil per day. A customer may also take 300 milligrams to 1.5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids every 24 hours.
